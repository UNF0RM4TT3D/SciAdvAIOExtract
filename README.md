To extract CPK files (Chaos;Head Noah, Robotics;Notes Elite and DaSH) an extra download of [CriPakTools.exe](https://github.com/esperknight/CriPakTools) is necessary.

MPV is generally able to recognise the format on even unknown video and audio files (if run from terminal). So if you want to extract A/V MPV or other software capable of detecting media formats is strongly recommended.
